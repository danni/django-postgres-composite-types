Django Postgres composite types
===============================

An implementation of Postgres' [composite types](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html)
for [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/).

Difference from the fork
-----

As of date, support for Django JSON form has been added to support the array of composites in the django admin
https://github.com/bhch/django-jsonform. The support is not good enough for a pull request, but it is at a working state.
The individual field templates are not as nice as the composite field widget from the parent repo here, but good enough!

Usage
-----

Install with:

    pip install django-postgres-composite-types

Then add 'postgres_composite_types' to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... Other apps
        'postgres_composite_types',
    ]

Define a type and add it to a model:

```python
from django.db import models
from postgres_composite_types import CompositeType

class Address(CompositeType):
    """An address."""

    address_1 = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    address_2 = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    suburb = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    state = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    postcode = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    class Meta:
        db_type = 'x_address'  # Required


class Person(models.Model):
    """A person."""

    address = Address.Field()
```

An operation needs to be prepended to your migration:

```python
import address
from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    operations = [
        # Registers the type
        address.Address.Operation(),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='person',
            name='address',
            field=address.Address.Field(blank=True, null=True),
        ),
    ]
```

Examples
--------

Array fields:

```python
class Card(CompositeType):
    """A playing card."""

    suit = models.CharField(max_length=1)
    rank = models.CharField(max_length=2)

    class Meta:
        db_type = 'card'


class Hand(models.Model):
    """A hand of cards."""
    cards = ArrayField(base_field=Card.Field())
```

Nested types:

```python
class Point(CompositeType):
    """A point on the cartesian plane."""

    # pylint:disable=invalid-name
    x = models.IntegerField()
    y = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        db_type = 'x_point'  # Postgres already has a point type


class Box(CompositeType):
    """An axis-aligned box on the cartesian plane."""
    class Meta:
        db_type = 'x_box'  # Postgres already has a box type

    top_left = Point.Field()
    bottom_right = Point.Field()
```

Gotchas and Caveats
-------------------

The migration operation currently loads the *current* state of the type, not
the state when the migration was written. A generic `CreateType` operation
which takes the fields of the type would be possible, but it would still
require manual handling still as Django's `makemigrations` is not currently
extensible.

Changes to types are possible using `RawSQL`, for example:

```python
operations = [
    migrations.RunSQL([
        "ALTER TYPE x_address DROP ATTRIBUTE country",
        "ALTER TYPE x_address ADD ATTRIBUTE country integer",
    ], [
        "ALTER TYPE x_address DROP ATTRIBUTE country",
        "ALTER TYPE x_address ADD ATTRIBUTE country varchar(50)",
    ]),
]
```

However, be aware that if your earlier operations were run using current DB
code, you will already have the right types
([bug #8](https://github.com/danni/django-postgres-composite-types/issues/8)).

It is recommended to that you namespace your custom types to avoid conflict
with future PostgreSQL types.

Lookups and indexes are not implemented yet
([bug #9](https://github.com/danni/django-postgres-composite-types/issues/9),
[bug #10](https://github.com/danni/django-postgres-composite-types/issues/10)).

Running Tests
-------------------
Clone the repository, go to it's base directory and run the following commands.

    pip install tox
    tox

Or if you want a specific environment

    tox -e py35-dj2.0
